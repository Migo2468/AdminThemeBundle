AdminThemeBundle fork
=====================

This branch is a slightly improved version of the [AdminThemeBundle](https://github.com/avanzu/AdminThemeBundle), 
bringing the AdminLTE theme to Symfony. 

This branch is the same as master but with the following branches merged on top:

- command-loading (see [#215](https://github.com/avanzu/AdminThemeBundle/pull/215))
- symfony4 (see [#215](https://github.com/avanzu/AdminThemeBundle/pull/216))
- dynamic options (see [#217](https://github.com/avanzu/AdminThemeBundle/pull/217))

It is not meant to be pushed as Pull Request, but only for demo purposes.
